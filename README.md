# Personal .files

It's not unusual to see folks manage their dotfiles in source control these
days, and this is nothing more than that.  As I'll be moving around a bit in the
coming months, I've decided to update a few things to make it easy to start on a
new machine.

## .bash\_profile

Custom PS1, aliases, colors.
Python environment and package configurations.
Auto-complete scripts, including for ssh hosts.

## .vimrc

Basic editor preferences, syntax, etc.
Shop/project specific configurations, some no longer used.

## .vim/ directory

Submodules for my favorite plugins.

* Command-T
* NERDTree
* jshint
* Flake8
* Fugitive
* Solarized
